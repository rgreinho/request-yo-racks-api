My first drink order was made wrong, and wasn't the tastiest (but was presented beautifully), but the staff was so exceptionally kind when I came in that I don't want to knock a star off. I have not found Austinites to be friendly, so it was a really pleasant surprise here that the employees were so nice. The inside is pretty nice and open, and the wifi is excellent. Good for people watching too - if you imagine the Austin resident stereotype, that is exactly what you will see here.\nUpdate: had the iced coffee and it was amazing! I am typically not a coffee fan (caffeine though) but this is great.",

Their coffee is fine, I usually get a black eye, but don't go for the coffee. Don't go for the food -- excluding the bagel dogs, I often kick my morning off with them. But really you go for more than acceptable coffee and over-salted snacks. \n\nGo for the Austin. Epoch is often what Austin is. Youngish, energetic/caffeinated, high speed internet, listening to music that you haven't heard of and reading books that seem deep, or are required by UT courses. \n\nEpoch has flaws -- but go get some caffeine, take a book that makes you look interesting and people watch your afternoon away.",
