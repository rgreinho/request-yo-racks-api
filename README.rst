Request-Yo-Racks REST API
=========================

A REST API for Request-Yo-Racks.

Quickstart
----------

Install `docker`_ and `docker-compose`_.

Setup the full environment::

  make

Start the services::

  docker-compose up [-d]

The ``-d`` switch allows you to start the services in the background. Without it, the logs would be printed on the
console, and you would need to press ``CTRL-C`` to stop the services.

Using the web devtools
----------------------

The ``loannister/web-devtools:1.1.0`` image contains all the tools you need to start the project (``polymer-cli``, ``bower``, ``gulp``, etc.). You do no necessaryly need to install any of them.

The unit test will run on ``Firefox ESR 52``.

``make help`` will show you the available targets.
